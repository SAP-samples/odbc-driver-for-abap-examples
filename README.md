# Examples for the ABAP ODBC driver
![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/odbc-driver-for-abap-examples)

## Description
This repository contains examples for using the _ODBC driver for ABAP_ in various programming languages.
Information on how to run the example programs and prerequisites can be found either as comments in the code or in `readme.md` files in the respective directories.

The folder `examples` contains the actual examples, most are sorted in subfolders for each programming language, the folder `unix` contains a configuration template for the `unixodbc` driver manager.

The folder `ABAP` contains a text representation of the ABAP objects required by the examples.
The contents is also released as the ABAP package `BASIS/SABP_MAIN/SABP/SABP_DBC2ABAP/SABP_DBC2ABAP_TEST`, but some objects might not be available in older releases.

## Requirements
All examples require the _ODBC driver for ABAP_ to be installed on the client.
It can be downloaded from the SAP Marketplace.

On Windows, the standard ODBC driver manager is used.
For Unix systems, the ODBC driver manager [unixodbc](https://www.unixodbc.org/) is required for almost all examples.
Other driver managers are not supported.

Some features showcased in the examples have minimum version requirements:

| Features | SAP system version | ODBC driver version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `select` | 2021 FPS01 | 01.00.0000 |
| `call` | 2025 / 2502 | 01.00.0018 |
| `insert`, `delete` | 2025 / 2508 | 01.00.0021 |

## Download and Installation
The examples in this repository are provided as source code.
They can be obtained by cloning the repository or by downloading individual files via the browser.
